# Dynamic stock price models

An __ongoing__ implementation of dynamic models of stock prices based on technical trading rules. 

A description of the models can be found in a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1888) published by [Li-Xin Wang](https://arxiv.org/find/q-fin/1/au:+Wang_L/0/1/0/all/0/1). For now, **the goal of this implementation is to reproduce the results obtained by Li-Xin Wang** for further study.
